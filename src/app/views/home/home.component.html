    <h5>Hope City is your city's connecting hub for local Church events and is designed to help you find a place to connect and serve.</h5>
    <p class="lead">Each one of us has a city that needs hope, yet many of us are unaware of how we can be a part of the bigger picture.
      We can bring hope in our families and in our Church but what about an entire city? Hope City is designed to host local Church events
      that are geared toward helping the city as a whole. Here, you can see local Church events, missions, and prayer meetings.</p>
      <h4>Find your tribe, volunteer, change your city.</h4>
