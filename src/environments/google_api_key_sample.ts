// this is a sample of how we are storing the API key
// we are using gitIgnore to ignore a file called api.ts
// api.ts is the folder where we are storing the api key in this project

// BELOW IS AN EXAMPLE OF HOW THE API KEY SHOULD LOOK IN THE api.ts file within the environments folder

export const GOOGLE_MAPS_API = {
  API: "GOOGLE_API_KEY_HERE"
};

// First half of the Google API key is here AIzaSyDXGrSmjNA
// second half of the API key is here Jy0qvEQthZiQGlXrSAryQuwY
